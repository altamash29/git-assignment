# Git Project

This project was completed by Altamash Shaikh and Sajid Shaikh as a learning exercise for Git and version control.

## Overview

We did a basic git project where there were 2 users, and I configured their emails and usernames user 1(me) needed to create 3 branches each branch needed to have 3 files and  then all the branches had to be merged with the main branch. then push them from git to github, then user 2(Sajid)  pulled that repository into his system made some changes to the files and the again committed and pushed them to github. then user 1 verified this task.
